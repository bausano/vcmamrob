In this project I will be looking into social robots, further, I will be discussing the matters I’ve been experiencing within the supermarket industry. It’s very unsatisfying to go to a supermarket and not be able to find the item you’re looking for, hence why I’ve designed this project.
My project involves a social robot. The aim of the robot is to assist customers within the supermarket, for example, if a customer can’t find a box of detergent, the supermarket robot will guide them to the shelf number instead of the current simple human navigation of “it should be in section 12”.
